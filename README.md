# weather-app

This weather app will allow you to check the current weather and a 5 day forcast for a city that you input.

There is a search bar where you can enter in your chosen city, as well as a list of previous searched cities. 

When you search you will recive the temperature, humidity, and wind speed. 

Moving forward I will add more CSS, and the save search feature.
